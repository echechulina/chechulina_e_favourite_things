# My favourite things
What do you know about me? Or what would you like to know about me? Perhaps about my work or travel experience, my attitude to Christmas trees in November, or to knitted sweaters for cats... I decided to tell you something about myself. In this app, you can learn about three of my favorite activities that I've been doing for many years.
